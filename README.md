# SharedTox
Repository of various Touchdesigner .tox files I made.

You can use these in any project within the limits of the GNU GPL-3 licence (commercial use = OK, closed source derivatives = not OK)

These tox files have ZERO warranty, I just make them for my own use, some will have problems, some will barely work, some will never be updated.
Feel free to submit helpful bug reports or code updates but don't expect me to give it priority!
